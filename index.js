  # rtc-signaller

  The `rtc-signaller` module provides a transportless signalling
  mechanism for WebRTC.

  ## Purpose

  The signaller provides set of client-side tools that assist with the
  setting up an `PeerConnection` and helping them communicate. All that is
  required for the signaller to operate is a suitable messenger.

  A messenger is a simple object that implements node
  [EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html) style `on` events for
  `open`, `close`, `message` events, and also a `send` method by which
  data will be send "over-the-wire".

  By using this approach, we can conduct signalling over any number of
  mechanisms:

  - local, in memory message passing
  - via WebSockets and higher level abstractions (such as
    [primus](https://github.com/primus/primus))
  - also over WebRTC data-channels (very meta, and admittedly a little
    complicated).

  ## Getting Started

  While the signaller is capable of communicating by a number of different
  messengers (i.e. anything that can send and receive messages over a wire)
  it comes with support for understanding how to connect to an
  [rtc-switchboard](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-switchboard) out of the box.

  The following code sample demonstrates how:

  <<< examples/getting-started.js

  ## Signal Flow Diagrams

  Displayed below are some diagrams how the signalling flow between peers
  behaves.  In each of the diagrams we illustrate three peers (A, B and C)
  participating discovery and coordinating RTCPeerConnection handshakes.

  In each case, only the interaction between the clients is represented not
  how a signalling server
  (such as [rtc-switchboard](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-switchboard)) would
  pass on broadcast messages, etc.  This is done for two reasons:

  1. It is out of scope of this documentation.
  2. The `rtc-signaller` has been designed to work without having to rely on
     any intelligence in the server side signalling component.  In the
     instance that a signaller broadcasts all messages to all connected peers
     then `rtc-signaller` should be smart enough to make sure everything works
     as expected.

  ### Peer Discovery / Announcement

  This diagram illustrates the process of how peer `A` announces itself to
  peers `B` and `C`, and in turn they announce themselves.

  ### Editing / Updating the Diagrams

  Each of the diagrams has been generated using
  [mscgen](http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/index.html) and the source for
  these documents can be found in the `docs/` folder of this repository.

  ## Reference

  The `rtc-signaller` module is designed to be used primarily in a functional
  way and when called it creates a new signaller that will enable
  you to communicate with other peers via your messaging network.

  ```js
  // create a signaller from something that knows how to send messages
  var signaller = require('rtc-signaller')(messenger);
  ```

  As demonstrated in the getting started guide, you can also pass through
  a string value instead of a messenger instance if you simply want to
  connect to an existing `rtc-switchboard` instance.

    broadcast to all peers connected to the signalling server).

  **/

    // iterate over the arguments and stringify as required

  /**
    ### announce(data?)

    The `announce` function of the signaller will pass an `/announce` message
    through the messenger network.  When no additional data is supplied to
    this function then only the id of the signaller is sent to all active
    members of the messenging network.

    #### Joining Rooms

    To join a room using an announce call you simply provide the name of the
    room you wish to join as part of the data block that you annouce, for
    example:

    ```js
    signaller.announce({ room: 'testroom' });
    ```

    Signalling servers (such as
    [rtc-switchboard](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-switchboard)) will then
    place your peer connection into a room with other peers that have also
    announced in this room.

    Once you have joined a room, the server will only deliver messages that
    you `send` to other peers within that room.

    #### Providing Additional Announce Data

    There may be instances where you wish to send additional data as part of
    your announce message in your application.  For instance, maybe you want
    to send an alias or nick as part of your announce message rather than just
    use the signaller's generated id.

    If for instance you were writing a simple chat application you could join
    the `webrtc` room and tell everyone your name with the following announce
    call:

    ```js
    signaller.announce({
      room: 'webrtc',
      nick: 'Damon'
    });
    ```

    #### Announcing Updates

    The signaller is written to distinguish between initial peer announcements
    and peer data updates (see the docs on the announce handler below). As
    such it is ok to provide any data updates using the announce method also.

    For instance, I could send a status update as an announce message to flag
    that I am going offline:

    ```js
    signaller.announce({ status: 'offline' });
    ```

  **/
  signaller.announce = function(data, sender) {
    clearTimeout(announceTimer);

    // update internal attributes
    extend(attributes, data, { id: signaller.id });

    // send the attributes over the network
    return announceTimer = setTimeout(function() {
      (sender || send)('/announce', attributes);
    }, (opts || {}).announceDelay || 10);
  };

  /**
    ### isMaster(targetId)

    A simple function that indicates whether the local signaller is the master
    for it's relationship with peer signaller indicated by `targetId`.  Roles
    are determined at the point at which signalling peers discover each other,
    and are simply worked out by whichever peer has the lowest signaller id
    when lexigraphically sorted.

    For example, if we have two signaller peers that have discovered each
    others with the following ids:

    - `b11f4fd0-feb5-447c-80c8-c51d8c3cced2`
    - `8a07f82e-49a5-4b9b-a02e-43d911382be6`

    They would be assigned roles:

    - `b11f4fd0-feb5-447c-80c8-c51d8c3cced2`
    - `8a07f82e-49a5-4b9b-a02e-43d911382be6` (master)

  **/
  signaller.isMaster = function(targetId) {
    var peer = peers.get(targetId);

    return peer && peer.roleIdx !== 0;
  };

  /**
    ### leave()

    Tell the signalling server we are leaving.  Calling this function is
    usually not required though as the signalling server should issue correct
    `/leave` messages when it detects a disconnect event.

  **/
  signaller.leave = function() {
    // send the leave signal
    send('/leave', { id: id });

    // call the close method
    if (typeof close == 'function') {
      close.call(messenger);
    }
  };

  /**
    ### to(targetId)

    Use the `to` function to send a message to the specified target peer.
    A large parge of negotiating a WebRTC peer connection involves direct
    communication between two parties which must be done by the signalling
    server.  The `to` function provides a simple way to provide a logical
    communication channel between the two parties:

    ```js
    var send = signaller.to('e95fa05b-9062-45c6-bfa2-5055bf6625f4').send;

    // create an offer on a local peer connection
    pc.createOffer(
      function(desc) {
        // set the local description using the offer sdp
        // if this occurs successfully send this to our peer
        pc.setLocalDescription(
          desc,
          function() {
            send('/sdp', desc);
          },
          handleFail
        );
      },
      handleFail
    );
    ```

  **/
  signaller.to = function(targetId) {
    // create a sender that will prepend messages with /to|targetId|
    var sender = function() {
      // get the peer (yes when send is called to make sure it hasn't left)
      var peer = signaller.peers.get(targetId);
      var args;

      if (! peer) {
        throw new Error('Unknown peer: ' + targetId);
      }

      // if the peer is inactive, then abort
      if (peer.inactive) {
        return;
      }

      args = [
        '/to',
        targetId
      ].concat([].slice.call(arguments));

      // inject metadata
      args.splice(3, 0, { id: signaller.id });

      setTimeout(function() {
        var msg = args.map(prepareArg).filter(Boolean).join('|');
        debug('TX (' + targetId + '): ' + msg);

        write.call(messenger, msg);
      }, 0);
    };

      announce: function(data) {
